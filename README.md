Yes, I remember your Pizza Delivery App project! 🍕

From our past conversations, here's what I recall:

You were building it as part of an internship project.

It had authentication, and you mentioned using files like authController.js and user.js in your controllers and models.

You were working on both frontend and backend, learning backend development step by step.

It was one of your first full stack projects, built likely using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and some frontend stack (maybe EJS or React).

Would you like me to:

Help you revisit or refactor the code?

Add new features?

Help with deployment, database integration, or frontend design?

Or just give you a summary of what you did?

Let me know what part you’re working on now.
